# Application-of-Bootstrap-samples-in-Random-Forest
Bootstrap means that instead of training on all the observations, each tree of RF is trained on a subset of the observations. The chosen subset is called the bag, and the remaining are called Out of Bag samples. This project involves in of bagging in Decision trees and implementation of random forest from scratch and also how to calculate the confidence intervals. The objective is Building the Random Forest without using sklearn, to learn how to make bootstrap samples for each Decision Trees and to learn how to calculate OOB score on out of bag samples.
